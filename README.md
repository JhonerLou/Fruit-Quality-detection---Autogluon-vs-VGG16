# Fruit-Quality-detection---Autogluon-vs-VGG16
This repository explores two different approaches for fruit quality detection, leveraging AutoGluon and VGG16 for image classification tasks. The goal is to classify fruits based on their quality, utilizing automated machine learning (AutoGluon) and deep learning (VGG16) models. Both approaches showcase different methodologies for training models on fruit quality datasets.

1. AutoGluon: Automated Machine Learning for Fruit Quality Classification

AutoGluon is an open-source library designed to make machine learning accessible by automating the training and hyperparameter optimization of models. This notebook utilizes AutoGluon for fruit quality classification, where the goal is to predict the quality of fruit images based on predefined categories (e.g., good, mixed, bad quality).

Key Features:

- Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) with minimal code.
- Ability to handle large datasets and complex image classification tasks.
- AutoGluon handles model selection, training, and hyperparameter tuning automatically.

Dependencies:

- autogluon
- numba==0.56.0
- pillow

Usage:
- Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
- Run the model training script that utilizes AutoGluon for automated image classification.
- AutoGluon will automatically preprocess the data, train multiple models, and provide the best-performing one.

2. VGG16: Transfer Learning for Fruit Classification

VGG16 is a deep convolutional neural network that has been pre-trained on ImageNet. In this notebook, we use VGG16 as a base model for transfer learning to classify fruit images based on their quality. This approach involves fine-tuning the VGG16 model on a custom fruit dataset.

Key Features:

- VGG16 model pre-trained on ImageNet, used as a base for transfer learning.
- Custom training on a fruit dataset with quality classification (e.g., rotten vs fresh, good vs bad).
- Focuses on utilizing deep learning for fruit quality classification by training a neural network.

Dependencies:

- tensorflow
- keras

Usage:

- Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
- Load the VGG16 model pre-trained on ImageNet.
- Fine-tune the model using your custom fruit dataset.
- Train the model and evaluate its performance.
- Comparing AutoGluon and VGG16


AutoGluon automates the machine learning pipeline, making it easier for non-experts to train models. It abstracts away the complexities of model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
VGG16 is a more traditional deep learning approach that requires hands-on management of data preprocessing, model design, and fine-tuning. It is a powerful model, but it requires more expertise in deep learning.
Both approaches can be effective, but AutoGluon is ideal for those looking for a fast and automated solution, while VGG16 provides more control over the model architecture and training process.
